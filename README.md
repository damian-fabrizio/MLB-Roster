# MLB-Roster

## This application will display the current roster of user selected MLB team!

## Function
Created in HTML, CSS, Javascript this project will disply to the user a list of all Major League Baseball teams and their accompanying logo. When the user selects a team that team's roster will be displayed on the screen. The roster is updated via an API to retrieve the most current roster data. Along with the name of the player their jersey number, position, height, and weight will be displayed. The background of the page will also change displaying the team colors and logos.

## Goals
To create a fun and interesting project to strengthen front-end skills alongside skills working with APIs. 

## Fixes
Could make page more interactive in terms of animations or buttons. Need to update responsiveness when page dimensions are changed. Also would like to make the diaplayed roster style a bit more visually pleasing
